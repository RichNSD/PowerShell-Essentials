## PowerShell Profile
If you plan to use PowerShell with any kind of regularity, you should consider customizing your PowerShell profile.

The PowerShell profile is a script that runs every time you start PowerShell. It is a great place to add customizations and functions that you want to be available every time you open a PowerShell session.

See the following official documentation for more information on the PowerShell profile:
- [Customizing your shell environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/shell/creating-profiles?view=powershell-7.5) 
	- Introductory overview of the PowerShell profile.
- [about_Profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-7.5)
	- This is a more in-depth look at the PowerShell profile.
	- You can find the same information by running `Get-Help about_Profiles` in PowerShell.
